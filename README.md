    "Waiter" by Team Coriolis

    The game was made by the following people :

    BobbyWatson (designer, lead programmer) (mathieu_hope@yahoo.com, AIM BobbyWatson100)
    Pegucha (art designer) (AIM : hertygerdy)
    LeiArchy9 (programmer) (AIM: Leiarchy9)

    How to play the game :

    Using the arrow keys, move the waiter around. To serve a client or to pick up pizzas, press the space bar. If the bar goes red next to the client, it means he is about to die of hunger. If one of the clients dies, the game is over.

    APIs used to make the game :
    SDL,
    SDL_image,
    SDL_mixer (though there is no sound)

    Developed and tested mostly on Mac OS X with XCode, compiled for Windows on Dev-C++.

    All required DLLs are included with the archive and do NOT need to be installed.
